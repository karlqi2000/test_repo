# @check-spelling/check-spelling GitHub Action

## Overview

Everyone makes typos. This includes people writing documentation and comments,
but it also includes programmers naming variables, functions, APIs, classes,
and filenames.

Often, programmers will use `InitialCapitalization`, `camelCase`,
`ALL_CAPS`, or `IDLCase` when naming their things. When they do this, it makes
it much harder for naive spelling tools to recognize misspellings, and as such,
with a really high false-positive rate, people don't tend to enable spell checking
at all.

This repository's tools are capable of tolerating all of those variations.
Specifically, [w](https://github.com/jsoref/spelling/blob/master/w) understands
enough about how programmers name things that it can split the above conventions
into word-like things for checking against a dictionary.
